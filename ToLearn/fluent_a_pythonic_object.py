# Object Representations
# repr(): Return a string representing the object as the developer wants to see it.
# str(): Return a string representing the object as the user wants to see it.

# As you know, we implement the special methods __repr__ and __str__ to support repr() and str().
# There are two additional special methods to support alternative representations of objects: __bytes__ and __format__.

# A Hashable Vector2d
# As defined, so far our Vector2d instances are unhashable, so we canâ€™t put them in a set.
# To make a Vector2d hashable, we must implement __hash__ (__eq__ is also required).

# Saving Space with the __slots__ Class Attribute
# If you are dealing with millions of instances with few attributes, the __slots__ class attribute
# can save a lot of memory, by letting the interpreter store the instance attributes in a tuple instead of a dict.
